# WeatherStation
Code for an Arduino UNO driven weather station, using the Sparkfun Weather Shield

## BOM
- Arduino UNO R3 model B (or similar UNO compatible board)
- Sparkfun Weather Shield for Arduino Uno R3

## Introduction
As an Arduino starter I wanted to built my first complete, and usable, project. A weather station seemed to be the next logical thing to do. As I was browsing for ideas I stumbled upon many instructables from others, but most of them kept it basic as in 'reading out data from the sensors'. Thus, not very exiting.
